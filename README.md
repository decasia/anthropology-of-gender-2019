# Anthropology of Gender and Sexuality 2019

This is a git repository with some teaching materials for a semester-length undergraduate course on anthropology of gender and sexuality.

## Course description

This course will give a general introduction to anthropological research on gender and sexuality in human societies. The course is divided into three sections. Part I introduces a number of basic concepts in gender analysis. Part II explores the relationship between gender and social reproduction. Part III examines gendered work, including housework, emotional labor, service work, and sex work. Our ethnographic cases will include the USA, South Africa, Indonesia, India, the UK, Mexico, Canada, Egypt, Barbados, and Madagascar. We will also do some research of our own about gender dynamics in our own immediate environments, and practice writing in public.
