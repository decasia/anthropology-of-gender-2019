# Ethnographic Exercise 3

## Interviews about coming home and leaving home

Due on September 29.

## Assignment

*Interview*

1. Find someone with whom you could have a comfortable conversation. It can be a friend, a colleague, an approachable stranger, or anyone else you like. (It does not need to have any connection to the place you previously have done your research assignments!)
2. Sit down with this person for an unstructured interview about 15-20 minutes long. The theme of the interview is: *coming home and leaving home*. It might make this more concrete to start out by saying you are interested in a typical day in their life.
3. Take notes on the conversation either during, afterwards, or both. It can work to just jot down a few phrases during the interview, and then sit down afterwards to write up something more extensive. It is also possible to take extensive notes during the interview, if it does not prove disruptive.
  
*Writing exercise*

1. Post a brief account on Medium of your experience. Describe your conversation in as much detail as you can, with multiple specific quotes. Start out by telling us about the person you spoke to â€” who are they and what are they like? (Sociologically? race/class/gender/age/nationality/etc? In terms of their clothes, posture, or other forms of presentation?)
2 After you finish telling us about the interview, reflect a little bit on what it tells you about *transitioning between spaces*. And what does this tell you about gender? Are spaces themselves gendered? Is "home" gendered?
3. Your account should be between 250-500 words long. (This is about 1-2 pages, double-spaced.)
4. Submit your work to me on Canvas by pasting the address of your post into the submission box!

*Notes on doing an interview*

The general theme is about coming and going home, but you could break this down into several parts.

1. About home itself: Do they have a home? If so, where's home? Do other people live with them, or live around them? What does it feel like to be at home? (Or, perhaps, to not have a home, or to have only a provisional home.)
2. Where else does this person usually go besides home? Work? School? Somewhere for recreation?
3. What's it like to leave home? Do they prepare for going out (say by changing clothes, gathering things to bring, saying goodbye, locking doors)? How do they usually travel (by car, bus, on foot, bike, etc)? What is it like to travel, or to be in between one space and the next?
4. What's it like to come home? Are there specific rituals for coming home (changing clothes, greeting someone, etc)? How does it feel to get home again (if there is a home to come back to)?

You don't have to ask about all these things. They are just suggestions for helping to get started.

Again, please, do explain that you are doing a class project, and then make sure the person agrees to talk to you for your project. It's fine to add that you won't include any names or identifying information in your assignment.
