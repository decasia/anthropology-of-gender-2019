# Ethnography of Gender Portfolio

Due on December 6

## Assignment

Ethnographic research is deeply shaped by your own path through the world. When you observe social life or talk to people, the results are always affected by your own identity, your own social location, and your own cultural knowledge. This includes, notably, your trajectory through gender, class, race, nationality, sexuality, language, and other dimensions of social existence.

Your final assignment for our class is to reflect on how your own path through the social world has shaped your own ethnographic research about gender. How did your biography shape your research experience? How did it affect your findings and your choice of sites? What does your ethnographic research say about *you*? 

You should approach your task in three steps:

1. Gather together your six ethnographic assignments and re-read them all as a set. Revise them, if you wish, to clarify or elaborate.
2. Then write a essay (at least 1500 words) reflecting on your own biography — including gender and any other relevant dimensions of life — and how it shaped your ethnographic research for this class. Specifically address at least one of the questions above.
3. Create a single document (MS Word or PDF) that includes all your (revised) ethnographic exercises as well as your final essay. Submit it to me on Canvas by the end of the day on December 6.

## Suggestions for writing

- The assignment is not to write your autobiography. Rather, you should make an *argument* about the role that your biography played in your own ethnographic research. It will surely be useful to discuss your own life experience as part of this project. But your essay should focus around a key claim that is supported by evidence and reflection. (This entails that you will have to figure out what your key claim is!)
- Context matters. You may want to go back to add further social context to your individual assignments (in terms of social geography, cultural location, intersectional sociology, etc). You may also bring up larger contexts in your final essay (the sociology of your family or childhood, the social geography of CWRU, etc).
- Titles are useful. Give your portfolio an informative title. Your individual ethnographic assignments should have good titles too.
- Clear, eloquent writing is always encouraged.
