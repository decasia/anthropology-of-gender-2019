# Ethnographic Exercise 4

## Research about gender politics

Due on October 6.

## Assignment

*Documentary research*

1. Locate a political, activist, or policy project that seeks to address an issue related to gender (very broadly speaking). 
2. Learn what you can about the project and its history. (This can be through online research, in the library, by in-person inquiry, by interview, or whatever form of inquiry works for you.) Find out how the project got started, what it hoped to accomplish, and how it hoped to reach its goals. Learn what you can about the success or failure of the project
3. Collect at least one document (physical or digital) that illustrates the project. (Many activist projects produce leaflets, artwork, posters, manifestos, or other documentary products; anything like this is fair game.)
  
*Writing exercise*

1. Post a brief account on Medium about your research. Teach us what the project was, and what you learned out about it, and why you chose to study it.
2. You might also want to comment on the gender and other (intersectional) social dynamics that emerged from the project in question.
3. Your account should be between 250-500 words long. (This is about 1-2 pages, double-spaced.)
4. Submit your work to me on Canvas by pasting the address of your post into the submission box!
