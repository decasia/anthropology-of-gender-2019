# Ethnographic Exercise 6

## Observations about emotional labor

Due on November 3.

## Assignment

*Observations*

1. Visit two different commercial establishments (retail, clubs, restaurants, salons, etc). During your visits, carefully observe the interactions between the staff and the public.
2. Pay special attention to the ways that the staff handles their encounters with the public. How do they present themselves to the public (in attire, eye contact, facial expressions, body language, linguistic or cultural signals)? Are they doing emotional labor to handle customers' feelings? Do they seem to change their strategies depending on the customer? What happens if there is a conflict or outburst?
3. Take notes on what you observe.
 
*Writing exercise*

1. Post a brief account on Medium of your experience. Compare the two workplaces. (Who are the workers and clients, intersectionally speaking?) Then describe on the processes of impression management or emotional labor that you observed.
2. You might also reflect a little bit on whether you have done this sort of work yourself (whether as part of a job or otherwise). What is it like for the staff to do emotional labor or impression management?
3. Your account should be between 250-500 words long. (This is about 1-2 pages, double-spaced.)
4. Submit your work to me on Canvas by pasting the address of your post into the submission box!
