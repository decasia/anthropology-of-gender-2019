# Paper 2

## Gender and reproduction

Due on October 27

## Assignment

This assignment is based on trying to describe the inner life of social reproduction, focusing on relationships to mothers or to partners (your choice).

1. Read Lauren Berlant's "Friction" and "For Example." Pick one of them to focus on.
2. Berlant comments at one point that "a thing is an enigmatic relation." She is thinking about the hospital phone that her mother is holding in a hospital bed. But you could broaden this point into the thought that reproduction is an enigmatic relationship as well.
3. Go back through the story that you have chosen to write about. Make a list of everything that is enigmatic in the story (e.g. sentences that are puzzling, details that are inexplicable, or anything else that catches your attention). Pay attention especially to the kinds of femininity that are being described, and to what you can learn here about women, in particular. 
4. Write an essay that explains what sorts of reproduction you see happening in your chosen story, and what is enigmatic about it. You may want to focus on what femininity means in your chosen story, and what women in particular are doing. 
5. Submit the completed essay to me on Canvas on October 27. It should be 1500-2000 words long (roughly 4-6 pages, double spaced). Do cite your sources (using any scholarly reference style that you are comfortable with).
