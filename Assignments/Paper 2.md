## The Enigmas of Reproduction

Due on October 27

## Assignment

This assignment is based on trying to describe the enigmas, dilemmas, and the weird details of social reproduction, focusing on relationships to mothers or to partners (your choice!).

1.    Read Lauren Berlant's "Friction" and "For Example." Pick one of them to focus on.
2.    Berlant comments at one point that "a thing is an enigmatic relation." She is thinking about the hospital phone that her mother is holding in a hospital bed. But you could broaden this point into the thought that reproduction is an enigmatic relationship as well.
3.    Go back through the story that you have chosen to write about. Make a list of everything that is enigmatic in the story (e.g. sentences that are puzzling, details that are inexplicable, or anything else that catches your attention). You might want to especially pay attention to the kinds of femininity that are being described, and to what you can learn here about women (who have also sometimes been cast as "enigmas" in patriarchal representation).
4.    Write an essay that explains what sorts of reproduction you see happening in your chosen story, and what is enigmatic about it. You may — but do not have to — focus on what femininity means in your chosen story, and what women are doing as reproductive actors.
5.    Submit the completed essay to me on Canvas on October 27. It should be 1500-2000 words long (roughly 4-6 pages, double spaced). You may refer to other readings if this is useful; please do cite your sources (using any scholarly reference style that you are comfortable with).
