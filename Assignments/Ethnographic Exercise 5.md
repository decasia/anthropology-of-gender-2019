# Ethnographic Exercise 5

## Interviews about social reproduction

Due on October 13.

## Assignment

*Interview*

1. Find someone — a parent, teacher, a caretaker, a service worker —  who has participated in the work of social reproduction. You can construe reproduction broadly -- it's about biological reproduction and childcare, but also about the whole socialization and education process. (This person does not need to have any connection to your previous research assignments.)
2. Sit down with this person for an unstructured interview about 15-20 minutes long. The theme of the interview is: *how do they feel about their role in reproduction, and how did they learn how to inhabit that role*. For example, "How do you feel about being a mother? How did you learn to be a mother?"
3. Take notes on the conversation either during, afterwards, or both. It can work to just jot down a few phrases during the interview, and then sit down afterwards to write up something more extensive. It is also possible to take extensive notes during the interview, if it does not prove disruptive.
  
*Writing exercise*

1. Post a brief account on Medium of your experience. Describe your conversation in as much detail as you can, with multiple specific quotes. Start out by telling us about the person you spoke to — who are they and what are they like? (Sociologically? race/class/gender/age/nationality/etc? In terms of their clothes, posture, or other forms of presentation?) Then tell us about the interview and what struck you about it. 
2. You might also reflect a little bit on what the interview tells you about *how reproductive roles are defined*. What is the relationship between reproductive roles and gender (femininity in particular)? How do people learn to do their roles? Who is teaching them?
3. Your account should be between 250-500 words long. (This is about 1-2 pages, double-spaced.)
4. Submit your work to me on Canvas by pasting the address of your post into the submission box!
