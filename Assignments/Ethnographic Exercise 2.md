# Ethnographic Exercise 2

## Gender and intersectional analysis

Due on September 13.

## Assignment

*Observation and very short interview exercise*

1. Return to the space that you visited for your first assignment. (*However*, if you were unhappy with your first site, you may pick another instead.)
2. Spend 30-45 minutes at the site. Pay close attention to what people are doing and *how it may reflect race, class, gender and sexuality.* (Or any other sort of social identity that is relevant.)
3. Take notes on anything that catches your attention.
4. Chat briefly with at least two people. Ask them about something that has caught your attention in the site. See what they make of their own situations.
  
*Writing exercise*

1. Post a brief account on Medium of your experience. Imagine that you are writing to someone who is interested in learning more about how gender, race and class get wrapped up together. Explain to them what you saw in your research, and what it says about how people are multiply positioned in the social world.
2. Your account should be between 250-500 words long. (This is about 1-2 pages, double-spaced.)
3. Submit your work to me on Canvas by pasting the address of your post into the submission box!

*Notes on talking to people*

- You should always explain that you are doing a class project, and then make sure the person agrees to talk to you for your project. It's fine to add that you won't include any names or identifying information in your assignment.
- It can be very sensitive to ask people directly about their views on gender, race, class, and other identity issues. Sometimes it is better to ask more low-key, indirect questions. This is especially true if you are talking to someone at work, or otherwise in a delicate position â€” remember that many people are under pressure to maintain appearances, to play a role, to be polite, to sell you something, etc. Don't expect that strangers, in particular, are able to be candid.
- Also, when you talk to people, it's often better to be concrete than abstract.
- Here's an example. Sometimes when I'm chatting with service workers, I like to ask if they get to pick the music playing on the stereo. This can bring out interesting things about people's tastes, their relationship to their employer, and other sociologically interesting things.
