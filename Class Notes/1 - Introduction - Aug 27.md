## Why should we study gender through labor and reproduction?

- We are studying less gender *identities* than gendered *social processes*.
- In the background: How do contemporary societies keep functioning?
- It takes *work* to keep a society going. Work is very often gendered.
- It also demands more or less successful processes of *social reproduction* over time.
- Reproduction is often a tenuous process.

---

## Why explore gender ethnographically? 

- The personal is (socio)political.
- The readings take us far from here, but gender is already around us.
- We're trying to hone our senses, our abilities to observe, to write.

## Key claims of the course

### Part 1: Basic concepts in gender, culture, and power

- Gender is a 'social construct'
- Gender interacts with race, class and other social processes
- Gender is organized around (hetero)sexuality
- Gender is political
- Gender organizes social space
- Gender fixates on the body
- Identities shift, and become hybrid, as they move through the world

---

### Part 2: Gender, sexuality and reproduction

- The way we see biology is cultural
- Reproduction is racialized
- Pregnancy has politics
- Reproduction is a pedagogical project
- Parental roles are (often) ambivalent
- As norms shift, reproduction becomes a problem
- While formal education remains a key scene of gender policing

---

### Part 3: Gender and labor

- Gender and class emerge together
- Emotions are work
- Cleaning a house is also work
- Feminized workplaces are sites of gender discipline and agency
- Workplace gender discipline is also sexual discipline
- It takes work to hide the work
- Work (often) can't hold up the world
- "People do things however they can" (in changing sexual economies)
- Work can reorganize the (sex) worker's self
- Although (sex) workers can also self-organize
