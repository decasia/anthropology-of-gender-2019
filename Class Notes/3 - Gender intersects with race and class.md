# Gender interacts with race, class and other social processes

Anthropology of Gender and Sexuality

September 3, 2019

## Patricia Hill Collins' project

- We are all multiple and have multiple parts, with different relations to power.
- The critique of the "additive" model of oppression (aka the "Oppression Olympics")
- The point of intersectional analysis is help to generate new coalitions, new "categories of connection"

## Categories of power analysis

- Institutional (ownership, production, political roles)
- Symbolic (gender "traits," stereotypes)
- Individual (we all carry around the baggage of hostile structures)

## Counter-project

- Exploring your location (opposing voyeurism, "academic colonialism")
- Generating coalitions
- Producing empathy (even though mistrust is necessary to many actors' survival)

## What are some ways that gender roles shift?

- Women entered the workforce, became "girl bosses"
- But actually: this refers to middle and upper-class women
- This in turn can shift the gender roles for men (there can be "stay-at-home dads")
- Intersects with gendered policies (e.g. is it maternity leave or is it parental leave in general?)
- Meanwhile in higher education, gender roles are shifting: humanities students have become feminized, STEM students tend to remain masculinized; the academic ranks often become more masculine as you go higher up on the pyramid.
