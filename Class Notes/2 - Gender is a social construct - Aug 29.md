Anthropology of Gender and Sexuality

## What is social construction?

- "Social construction" is a *process*. (If we say *something is a social construct*, this is shorthand for *something is the result of social construction*.)
- "Construction" is a process of *making* or even *building*
- We do this construction together: that's why we call it *social*. It's collective. It happens in groups.

## What does it mean that gender is socially constructed?

- Gender is **arbitrary**. It could be different.
- Gender is **not directly the result of biology or human nature**.
- There are no traits, tastes, personality traits, or behaviors that follow naturally from having a male or female body.

## Gender is a system

- Different gender categories evolve separately. There are specific histories of women, of womanhood, of femininity. 
- There is space for variation within genders. There are different kinds of men, different masculinities.
- Boundaries are not absolute. Men can exhibit femininity, nonbinary people can exhibit masculinity, etc, etc.
- There are structural relationships between genders, but this can vary in form (a "gender binary" is very different from a "gender spectrum").

## Gender as meanings

## Gender as conventions vs moments
