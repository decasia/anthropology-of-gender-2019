# Key claims of the course

Each claim — some more empirical, some more conceptual — has its own course session and reading.

## Part 1: Basic concepts in gender, culture, and power

- Gender is a 'social construct'
- Gender interacts with race, class and other social processes
- Gender is organized around (hetero)sexuality
- Gender is political
- Gender organizes social space
- Gender fixates on the body
- Identities shift, and become hybrid, as they move through the world

## Part 2: Gender, sexuality and reproduction

- The way we see biology is cultural
- Reproduction is racialized
- Pregnancy has politics
- Reproduction is a pedagogical project
- Parental roles are (often) ambivalent
- As norms shift, reproduction becomes a problem
- While formal education remains a key scene of gender policing

## Part 3: Gender and labor

- Gender and class emerge together
- Emotions can become work
- Cleaning a house is also work
- Feminized workplaces are sites of gender discipline and agency
- Workplace gender discipline is also sexual discipline
- It takes work to hide the work
- Work (often) can't hold up the world
- "People do things however they can" (in changing sexual economies)
- Work can reorganize the (sex) worker's self
- Although (sex) workers can also self-organize
